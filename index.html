            <a name="intro"></a>
            <h2>How do people interact with a shower/bathtub</h2>

            <p class="lead">For taking shower or a bath, they share common sequence of actions. The user would have couple of things that they would have think about in order take a comfortable shower/bath.
                The things that they would have to think about is the temperature of the water that is coming out of the faucet or the shower head. For a shower the user would have think about the pressure of
                the water coming out of the shower head. Then for bath they would also think about the height of the water.</p>


               <p class="lead"> The temperature of the water is the most important thing to think about when taking a bath/shower because water would have to be comfortable for the user. User would have to know how hot or cold
                the water that their using. If the water coming out of the faucet/shower head is to hot it can be dangerous for the user. The maximum water settings for shower/bath must be limited to what is
                comfortable for a user. Nor should the water to be too cold but that is not as life threating as for the water being dangerously hot.</p>

                <p class="lead"> When taking a shower, pressure plays crucial role for the user. Depending on the user they except a certain amount of pressure coming out of the shower head. Some user like certain amount of pressure
                to coming out of the head that is not to low nor to high. If the shower head pressure is not adjustable then it would not be the best for the user. Being able to adjust the pressure is secondary importance
                to temperature for a shower.</p>

                <p class="lead"> For taking a bath, the height and width of the tube is an important. The tube must be able to fit the user and be at certain height that is desirable for the user. If the tube is not, then it would not be
                good from a usability perspective since it would be comfortable if the tube is overflowing with water and your still not at your desired level water that wanted in the tube.</p>
            </p>

            <h2>Common/Uncommon uses for Shower/Bathtube</h2>
            <ul class="lead">
                <li>Wash hair</li>
                <li>Wash a stain from a pair of clothing</li>
                <li>To fill bucket of water</li>
                <li>Wash a mop</li>
                <li>Wash dirty shoes</li>
                <li>Brew beer</li>
                <li>Wash hands</li>
                <li>Fill container of water</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>How does the Shower/Bathtube help a user figure out how to use it</h2>

            <p class="lead">The shower helps the user figure out how it works by giving output according to what your turning or pulling. When you turn the main knob left, it will give you hot water.
                As you keep turning the knob it will give you feedback that the water is getting hotter. The same could be said when turning the knob right to get cold water.
                This feedback comes either from the faucet or the shower head to tell you the temperature of the water. </p>

            <p class="lead">
                The user is able figure out the pressure of the water by how much water is rushing out of the faucet or the shower head. When the user pulls on the shower head it increases the pressure of the water coming out.
                When the knob is pulled far enough you will get the maximum amount of water pressure that is available. The user will see this feedback by how much water is coming out.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                On the top of the faucet there is leveler which allows the user to choose the flow of the water coming out. When the leveler is pulled up, water will come out of the shower head and if the leveler is pulled down,
                water will come out of the faucet.
            </p>



            <h2>How does the system show the state of the system to the user</h2>

                <p class="lead">The shower/bathtub have a couple of different visual cues on the state of it. Visual cues that can give a user the state of it is rust or grime on the metal of the shower head or faucet.
                    Rust can show up around the metal of these surfaces. If the state of the shower/bathtub is not clean enough mold can appear on the wall or in the tub itself. </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    Other cues to the state of the system is it performing the action that it supposed to do. If water is not coming out of the faucet or shower head, then there must be issue with the plumbing.
                    Another cue to the state of the system is the water draining. If the water is not draining from the tub, then there must be something stopping the flow of the water.
                </p>

         <h2>How easy is it for guest to use</h2>
            <p class="lead">The interface that is in my shower/bathtubs is standard from what I have come across in many other showers/bathtubs. When I first used it was easy for me to figure out how to use it and have do what I wanted to do.
                If I had guest come over to use my shower/bathtubs I believe they would have easy time figure out how to it.</p>
            <p class="lead"> Hot water is on the left and cold water is on the right which I believe is pretty much standard for American’s. The only thing that could be issue is adjust the pressure since
                first user might not know that you have pull the knob to adjust the water pressure. </p>
            <p class="lead">The leveler on the faucet is pretty much standard way of deciding where the water is coming from. It is pretty much the action of pull it up or leaving down for water to flow out
                of either the shower head or the faucet itself. </p>
            <p class="lead"> The only people I believe would have problem would be those who haven’t lived in America since the way our bathtubs/showers are designed are standard.</p>

            <h2> The Good</h2>

            <p class="lead">
                The mapping of everything in the shower/bathtub is good. The shower head is at high enough height and I can adjust the angle of it. So when I use the shower the water is coming down upon instead
                of on my shoulders, so I don’t have to slouch to wash my hair. The knob to the control the water is at easily accessible area of the shower. The handle is in the middle so I reach it won’t have to bend down or reach up to adjust the settings for the shower.  The faucet is at a decent high, little bit further down from the knob to control the water.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                The Interface to control the water is pretty simple and not overly complicated. There only one knob, which has three ways that it can be manipulated. You can turn it to the left to produce hot water. Turn it to the right to get cold water. Pull it out to adjust the pressure. These three actions are pretty much simple and easy to use.
                It does not require any additional thinking to get it to do these actions.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                On the faucet there is a leveler which allows the user to change flow of water from the faucet to the shower head or vice-versa. The action to perform this task is relatively simple and does not require much thinking from the user.
                The user either has to just pull onto to make water flow from the shower head or push-down on it for water flow from the faucet.
            </p>

            <h2> The Bad</h2>

            <p class="lead">On the Knob for the shower/bathtub there is no way for first time user to tell if they should pull on the knob to control the water pressure. This leave the user to either have guess that it is
                action that is possible or find it by chance. </p>
